# Tournament Header

This is a simple app which allows anyone to remotely create and edit graphical headers for use in events such as fighting game tournaments.

The project is currently live at: https://frostemanneogard.github.io/TournamentHeader/

## How to use

### Creating a header
1. Go to the "Home" page and press "Create a new header".
2. Enter an ID for the header you want to create. This will be the "name" of your header. People can search for the ID to edit the header. **Only give out the ID to those you want to have editing access.**
3. Press "Proceed". This will create your header and redirect you to the editor for your header.

### Editing an existing header:
1. Go to the "Home" page and press "Edit an existing header".
2. Enter the ID for the header you want to edit, then press "Proceed".
3. When in the editor, make any appropriate changes.
4. Press "Submit" to update your changes.

### Inserting your header into streaming/recording software:
1. Enter the editor by creating a new header or editing an existing one (see instructions above).
2. While in the editor, press the "Copy render URL" button.
3. Paste the copied URL into a browser source in your streaming/recording software of choice. Make sure to set the width and height to 1920x1080 pixels.
4. You're all set! You can now edit your header remotely from any device via the editor and the result will be updated live.
